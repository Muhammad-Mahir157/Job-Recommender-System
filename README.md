The model would be based on the Collaborative Filtering ML technique that identifies the relationship between pieces of data.

# Scope:

2. This system uses information filtering techniques to process information and provide the user with more relevant data to their specific needs.
3. The recommender system would be based on the collaborative filtering that uses similarities between users and items simultaneously to provide recommendations. It works in a way that even a recommendation would be provided to a user A based on another user B having similar interests
